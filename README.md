# phyzzy-js
A tiny 2d physics simulator. Uses a system of masses and springs to create
objects that bounce and jiggle. The main goal of Phyzzy is to make use of a
verlet-based 2d physics simulator with modular characteristics. 
It is possible to add new forces and constraints by modifying the input force
and input collision calculations.

This project is currently a work in progress. There are still many features to 
be added as well as a couple of bugs to fix.
