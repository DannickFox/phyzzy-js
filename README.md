phyzzy.js
A tiny 2d physics simulator. Uses a system of masses and springs to create
objects that bounce and jiggle.

This library can draw onto the html5 canvas element however this function can be
omitted completely.

To use:
1.- Create or load a Mesh() object.
2.- Create or load an Environment() object.
3.- Create a Phyz() object.

Once finished, you are ready to use phyzzy-js for spring-mass simulation!
